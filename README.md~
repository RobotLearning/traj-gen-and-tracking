ROADMAP

- Reading ILC review + papers
- Read control chapter of both books
- Look at last ACC papers on ILC
- Clean-up: Check out Yanlong's and Katharina's code.
- Read system identification survey
- Derive Kalman filter from minimum variance and derive seperation principle.
- SL code debugging framework in Eclipse
- ATLAS/BLAS library integration with SL (wrapper?)
- Write down robust trajectory generation framework for table tennis
- (Guilherme) Extrapolating ILC. Boosting ILC with weak learners?

Notes:
- compare kinematics with SL
- test performance of ILC with linearization at each iteration
- why doesn't ball and robot trajectory coincide in simulations? check kinematics in MATLAB
- check total least squares on the ball prediction dataset
- Why does ILC learning with feedback generate zero Finv?
- Load constraints umin and umax, joint limits from sensor offsets file and include in lift_constraints
- Try IDM as fb in MATLAB
- Test LQG and iLQR, DDP on MATLAB
- Implement REPS, PI2 algorithms on MATLAB, variational Bayes
- Articulate inverse dynamics in MATLAB does not match to SL! [in SL it is as good as NE]
implement the test function in MATLAB that checks for differences
- Why are two tracking LQRs not exactly the same (at the end)? 
  [maybe R dependence is not correct, index difference?]

Robot list:
- Test error feedback based weighting on the Q matrix
- Correct initial conditions of zero-phase filtering and test in MATLAB with ILC
- Implement/Learn RDMP first in MATLAB and then in SL
- Wrist problem in robot computer?
