TODO List:

- Show wILC converges for linear models
- Why are two tracking LQRs not exactly the same (at the end)? 
  [maybe R dependence is not correct, index difference?]
- Effects of error coupling on DMPs?
- Track different trajectories with RR, RRR
- Fix the output matrix problem (C being nonidentity) for nonlinear models
