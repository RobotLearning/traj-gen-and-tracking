TODO List:

- Why are two tracking LQRs not exactly the same (at the end)? 
  [maybe R dependence is not correct, index difference?]
- Effects of error coupling on DMPs?
- How to avoid large accelerations/large control inputs at start/end
  of trajectory?
- wILC should work also for state space models not in the form 
  [x1,x2,...,xN,x1d,x2d,...,xNd]
