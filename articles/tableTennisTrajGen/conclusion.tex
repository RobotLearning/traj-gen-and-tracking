\section{CONCLUSION}\label{end}

% shall we put inv. dynamics eq here?
The cost functional to be minimized considers the accelerations as the quantity to be minimized. It assumes that the feedback linearization of the robot is perfect, that is the inverse dynamics model for the robot is exact. Whenever the cancellation is imperfect due to inaccurate robot control, execution error will prevent the robot from achieving the desired trajectories. Execution errors will be considered in future work.
