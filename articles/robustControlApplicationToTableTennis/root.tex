\section{Robust Control Applications to Table Tennis}

\subsection{Game Theoretic Analysis}

What actions are available to players? Position and body orientation with racket position and body orientation
(initial gesture) and hitting motions (trajectories) as dynamic movement primitives.

Timing of the interactions - sequential model. But not always at the same time

What information do different players have when they take actions? 
They see the opponent's posture always and also their hitting motion. They will also see the incoming ball trajectory - but maybe not everything if it's coming too fast. They may or may not know the spin of the ball.
Sometimes you have to choose, or take action, before seeing the opponent hit the ball.

What are the payoffs to the various players as a result of the interaction?
For the players there are no payoffs unless the ball does not touch the table on the other side. In that case, one gets 1 and the other gets 0.

Sensitivity analysis - am I acting strategically enough?

Pure strategies over actions vs. mixed strategies

Dominant strategy - an individual does not have to make any predictions about what other players
might do, and still has a well-defined best strategy. This adds robustness.

A pure strategy Nash equilibrium only requires that the
action taken by each agent be best against the actual equilibrium actions taken by the other
players, and not necessarily against all possible actions of the other players.
"we have to look for a pair of actions such that neither firm wants
to change its action given what the other firm has chosen"

A profile of dominant strategies is a Nash equilibrium but not vice versa.

randomized strategies, or what are called mixed strategies, when no pair of pure strategies forms an equilibrium.
maximize entropy - do not reveal info to the opponent, he shouldn't be able to predict your future behaviour given past samples.

is table tennis an extensive form game? Game tree? backwards induction
