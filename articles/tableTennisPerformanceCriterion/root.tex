\begin{abstract}

In highly dynamics tasks that involve moving targets, planning is necessary to figure out when, where and how to intercept the target. In robotic table tennis in particular, conventional planning algorithms often rely on the virtual hitting plane hypothesis to construct robot striking trajectories. These algorithms however are vulnerable to modeling and execution errors. %For example, the trajectories they generate are not robust to uncertainty in ball position and velocity at hitting time. 
Moreover, they do not take advantage of the inherent task redundancy when planning trajectories. In this paper, we address these two issues by introducing a new performance criterion for robotic table tennis. We use an optimal control approach to construct a novel inverse-kinematics algorithm that does not involve a fixed hitting plane. Furthermore, by augmenting our cost functional with a probabilistic final-cost we incorporate the uncertainties in modeling, estimation and execution as well as task redundancy. Our algorithm returns the balls with a higher probability to the opponents court in two and three dimensional table tennis with different robot models when compared with a state of the art planning approach.

\section{INTRODUCTION}

The opponent's court in table tennis, the net and other environmental restrictions such as walls together define a natural \emph{stability region} that is intrinsic to the game: the table tennis playing robot implementing our favorite reinforcement learning and control algorithm will lose a point if they cannot land the ball on the other side of the table. Taken in a wider sense, this stability region is a result of the redundancy in task-specification, and should be exploited as much as possible in all robotic tasks. 
% $\court$

An aspect in table tennis that strengthens this point is the uncertainty in ball estimation. As a result of limitations in the sensing hardware as well as in our simple physical models that neglect certain dynamics, the ball cannot be estimated or predicted perfectly within the workspace of the robot. In an ideal world where this could be done, exploitation of task-redundancy could indeed be relegated to a higher-level strategy, as is often done in previous works in table tennis~\cite{Muelling13}. However, whenever there is ball uncertainty, being aware and taking advantage of the stability region is critical and directly contributes to generating successful playing styles.
%  It is difficult to estimate the center of mass of the ball from image data. Small errors in position can accumulate to much larger errors in velocity estimates. Moreover, the ball is very light and some effects such as spin cannot be predicted precisely even with sophisticated modelling.

% But nobody should blame them if they land the ball precisely on a target point but only within a certain region of it: they do not have to! Even humans with very agile striking capabilities are not able to return the ball to a precise location.
% mention human studies in this aspect

In this paper, we incorporate probabilistic modeling for robust trajectory generation and come up with a new performance criterion in table tennis that exploits the game's natural stability criterion. The cost functional that we try to minimize is not \emph{certainty-equivalent} and naturally leads to \emph{cautious} strategies. Moreover it is particularly suitable for employing adaptive strategies as the robot gets more data and refines its internal models of the environment. 

Our approach involves intensive modeling of task-relevant quantities from data, e.g. ball flight, bounce models and ball-racket contact modeling. The last one especially can be hard to train from missing data. However, we keep the uncertainty of all of our models and use them also in our decision-making process. This cautious design is an asset that differentiates our approach from previous approaches (e.g. \cite{Matsushima05}, \cite{Muelling13}) that are less robust to modeling and estimation uncertainty.
% from missing data and can even be misleading when given example ball trajectories with high spin.

To summarize our reasons for introducing uncertainty and probabilistic modeling to trajectory generation in table tennis: \textit{i)} Table tennis balls are very light and cannot be estimated or predicted precisely. \textit{ii)} Racket-ball interaction is generally not known well and the elasticity of the momentum exchange differentiates it from the mirror laws used in the literature so far. \textit{iii)} The set of allowed landing point specifications in the opponent's side can be incorporated to design robust algorithms that return the ball with a higher probability, when under the influence of various effects mentioned in \textit{(i)} and \textit{(ii)}. See figure~\ref{mainIdea} for an illustration.% ref needed obviously 
% velocity dependent coefficient of restitution

% The choice of the the desired landing point of the ball on the opponent's court is generally left to a higher level strategy or policy of the robot. However in this paper we argue that landing the ball successfully on the opponent's court is the \emph{fundamental goal} in table tennis. Therefore policies or the strategies involved in striking movement generation should be combined in one unitary whole.

Introducing uncertainty into planning and a more cautious generation of striking trajectories will allow us to return the ball with a higher probability.}

In the rest of this paper, we elaborate on this notion of robustness, giving more examples and the necessary intuition where needed. In Section~\ref{relatedWork} we introduce previous work on table tennis and other relevant trajectory generation frameworks. In Section~\ref{method} we formalize robot trajectory generation as a specific optimal control problem and incorporate probabilistic modeling within this framework. We do not know of any closed-form solutions even in simplified cases. In Section~\ref{alg} we discuss a Monte-Carlo based rejection sampling approach for optimizing the previously introduced cost functional. In Section~\ref{results} we evaluate the performance of this approach and compare it with previous inverse kinematics (IK) approaches. When the inverse dynamics models are not known well for the robot, robustness with respect to trajectory \emph{execution} must be additionally considered. In the final section~\ref{end} we discuss several promising extensions in this regard. %VHP-based

\section{METHOD}\label{method}

In table tennis, one needs to determine when, where and how to intercept the incoming ball trajectory. So far, most of the algorithms for robotic table tennis \cite{Muelling13} calculate the intersection point of an estimated ball trajectory with a Virtual Hitting Plane (VHP) to determine the space and time coordinates of the hitting point. To estimate the trajectory of the ball, we require as data, a stream of estimates of ball position. We terminate the estimation process after a bounce event has been detected with high probability. 
% do we really need a fixed event such as bounce to terminate the estimation process?
%It is possible to eliminate this termination event altogether and vary the robot trajectory launch times based on ball estimates.

For safety reasons, VHP algorithms need to specify a minimum hitting time $T_{\textrm{min}}$ in addition to the coordinates of the hitting plane. When the ball is coming very fast towards the VHP, any calculated trajectory of duration below the minimum time will simply not be executed. This will prevent high accelerations and any risk of damage to the robot. However the determination of this minimum hitting time can be arbitrary, and the algorithms involving a VHP can lead to unnecessarily strict or restrictive strokes.
% impact time, ball position and velocity
% time to contact

After accounting for the net and any other environmental constraints such as walls, the stability region of table tennis reduces to the Cartesian coordinates of the table $\court$ as a rectangular region with a fixed vertical distance $z_{\court}$ from origin. Any algorithm that can return the ball to this fixed region can be said to be \emph{stable}.


\subsection{Learning Models From Data}

% air resistance scale factor C 
% $\ballFull = (\ball^{\mathrm{T}},\dot{\ball^{\mathrm{T}}})^{\mathrm{T}}$
We require three models for the trajectory generation process and acquire them (iteratively) from raw ball data. The ballistic \emph{flight model} $\ddot{\ball} = \ballDynamics(\dot{\ball})$ is a nonlinear model that describes the ball dynamics and generally involves air drag $\drag$ and gravity $\gravity$. The \emph{rebound model} $\dot{\ball}_{\mathrm{out}} = \bounce\dot{\ball}_{\mathrm{in}}$ is a discrete event with diagonal entries of $\bounce$ as coefficients $\epsilon = [\epsilon_{x}, \epsilon_{y}, -\epsilon_{z}]$. The coefficient of restitution $\epsilon_{z}$ accounts for the reflection of velocity in the vertical direction $z$ and $\epsilon_{x}, \epsilon_{y}$ are the coefficients of friction along the planar $x,y$ directions.
% incoming ball trajectory: as Gaussians indexed with time [e.g. Kalman filter should give us this information with prediction. Parameters/model of a Kalman filter could be fit using ball data (when fitting, innovation of the KF should be minimized as to consist mostly of white noise)]

% A probabilistic model describing the interaction model: outputs a probability distribution of outgoing ball states parameterized (or indexed) by t, e.g. b_t \approx N(\mu_b_out(t), \sigma_b_out(t))

% build a forward/inverse interaction model probabilistically
The last model to train from data is the \emph{ball-racket contact model} $\ \dot{\ball}_{\mathrm{out}} = \contact(\dot{\ball}_{\mathrm{in}},\dot{\racket},\orient)$. This model is significantly harder to train from the previous models, as it requires ball-racket interaction data and it is difficult to get reliable ball estimates around hitting time. We need to instead rely on smoothing using the trained flight model and the samples before and after hitting. In previous works, the outgoing velocity of the ball is calculated using a \emph{mirror law}: $o_{\parallel} - v = \epsilon_{R} (-i_{\parallel} + v)$ with $v$ the speed of the racket along its normal and $\epsilon_{R}$ the coefficient of restitution on the racket. $o_{\parallel}$ and $i_{\parallel}$ are the outgoing and incoming ball velocities along the racket, respectively. This model assumes an elastic momentum exchange and it is quite inaccurate, especially at high ball velocities.
% is this true? is the parallel o and i definitions correct?

The accuracy of these models all depend on each other and for this reason, we train the parameters of these models with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Effects of angular velocity, or in other words spin, are not accounted for in these models. During test time when running these trained models online, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or any regression method to estimate initial ball position and velocity can use these models to perform prediction and update steps.

\subsection{Predicting with Probabilistic Modeling}

% density or distribution
Using an EKF for our nonlinear model $\ballDynamics$ generates at each time instant $t$ a probability distribution $p_t(x,y,z|t)$ of incoming ball states parameterized by time, e.g. $\ball_t \sim \mathcal{N}(\vec{\mu}_{\textrm{in}}(t),\vec{\Sigma}_{\textrm{in}}(t))$. 

% % % EXT. KALMAN FILTER EQUATIONS HERE % % %

Formally this is a stochastic process, and for the Kalman Filter with a noisy process model, a Brownian motion. However we set the process covariance to zero during prediction, as the sample paths of the exponential kernel used in the Kalman Filter framework are very rough, i.e. almost surely not differentiable.

% Interaction probabilities (ball touching the racket)
Prediction continues after a possible interaction with the racket trajectory. If the ball touches the racket, i.e. if the surface of the ball is located inside the radius $\racketRadius = 8$ cm of the racket plane, ball incoming velocities will be transformed according to the trained contact model. Otherwise the ball with continue its previous projectile-like motion. Prediction is stopped when the ball hits the table plane with negative velocity in the $z$ direction.

\subsection{Optimal Control for Trajectory Generation}

From a set point of view, for every point on the predicted ball trajectory, there is a range of admissible outgoing ball velocities that the racket can impart. This set is constricted by the geometry of the table and the demands of the game: the ball has to avoid the net and the walls and should land on the opponents court. Probabilistically speaking, the landing point could be any distribution with compact support over the table, e.g. a uniform distribution $x_{\textrm{land}}, y_{\textrm{land}} \sim \mathcal{U}(\court) = \mathcal{U}(x_{a},x_{b})\mathcal{U}(y_{a},y_{b})$ or a truncated normal distribution. The limiting values $x_{a},x_{b},y_{a},y_{b}$ are obtained from the rectangular geometry of the opponent's court.
%

Our optimization criterion of choice is to find the racket trajectory that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence $\textrm{KL}(p\|q) = \int_{\court}p(x,y)\log(\frac{p(x,y)}{q(x,y)})\textrm{d}x\textrm{d}y$ of $p(x,y|z_{\court},\dot{z} < 0) = \int_{\hitTime = 0}^{\infty} p_{\hitTime}(x,y|z_{\court},\dot{z} < 0,\hitTime)\hitDist \textrm{d}\hitTime$ with a desired distribution imposed by the robotic player. $p(x,y|z_{\court},\dot{z} < 0)$ is the marginal distribution over time of the ball process $p_t(\cdot)$. Other more agnostic optimization criteria could also be formulated to minimize the racket trajectory sensitivity to perturbations in the ball trajectory. However these would not take advantage of the uncertainty quantification of the ball trajectory, in our case supplied by EKF.

% what about maximizing the probability of landing, regardless of any specified distribution?
% is this true?
Any specified distribution $q(\cdot)$ of compact support $\court$ will indirectly maximize the probability of landing on the table, $\prob(\textrm{land}) = \int_{0}^{\infty}\landDist\textrm{d}\landTime$. Here $\landTime$ is a \emph{hitting time} random variable of the set $\court$. In addition, for maximal unpredictability, the robot player can choose the uniform distribution over the table as a desired distribution. In this case the optimization reduces to maximizing the entropy of the landing distribution on the table. 

For safety and efficiency, we would prefer trajectories with minimal acceleration or jerk, the derivative of acceleration. Combining the minimal acceleration criterion with the KL-divergence we get
%
\begin{align}
\min \int\limits_{0}^{T}\ddot{\joint}(t) + \textrm{KL}(p(x,y|z_{\court},\dot{z}<0)|\mathcal{U}(\court)),
\label{costFnc1}
\end{align}
%
where the marginal distribution $p(x,y|z_{\court},\dot{z}<0)$ of the ball process can be written as
%
% should we give also the probability of landing here?
\begin{align}
p(x,y|z_{\court},\dot{z}<0) &= \int_{\landTime = 0}^{\infty} p_{\landTime}(x,y|z_{\court},\dot{z}<0,\landTime)\hitDist \textrm{d}\landTime \label{marginalDistr1}, \\
p_{\landTime}(x,y|z_{\court},\dot{z}<0,\landTime) &= \frac{ \int_{\dot{z}=-\infty}^{0}\int_{\dot{x},\dot{y}}p_{\landTime}(x,y,z_{\court},\dot{x},\dot{y},\dot{z}|\landTime)}{p(z_{\court},\dot{z}<0)}.
\label{marginalDistr2}
\end{align}
%
The marginal distribution over $x,y$ velocities appearing in the numerator of \eqref{marginalDistr2} is
\begin{align}
& p_{\landTime}(x,y,z,\dot{z}|\landTime) = \int_{\hitTime = 0}^{T} \int_{\dot{x},\dot{y}}  p_{\landTime}(x,y,z,\dot{x},\dot{y},\dot{z}|\ball_{\textrm{out}},\dot{\ball}_{\textrm{out}},\landTime) \times \\
& p(\dot{\ball}_{\textrm{out}}|\dot{\ball}_{\textrm{in}},\dot{\racket}(\hitTime),\orient(\hitTime),\hitTime)p(\ball_{\textrm{out}}|\ball_{\textrm{in}},\racket(\hitTime),\orient(\hitTime),\hitTime)\hitDist\textrm{d}\hitTime.
\label{fullDistr}
\end{align}
%
where $\hitTime$ is the hitting time random variable corresponding to the time of ball-racket contact, $\prob(\textrm{hit}) = \int_{0}^{T}\hitDist\textrm{d}\hitTime$. In \eqref{fullDistr} the probability densities are obtained using the trained models, i.e. the flight model and the ball-racket contact model. 

By formulating \eqref{costFnc1} in joint space, we find the joint trajectory $\joint(t)$ that provides a suitable trade-off between minimum joint accelerations $\ddot{\joint}(t)$ and maximum probability of landing $\prob(\textrm{land})$. Using direct kinematics we can obtain the desired racket trajectory and orientations, i.e. $[\racket(t),\orient(t)] = \kin(\joint(t))$.

%

% Refer to article for the simplest case when diving two Gaussians with nonzero mean.
We do not know of any way to compute the ball landing distribution in closed form, as a function of racket positions and orientations. However, the outgoing ball trajectory is an integral over the previous incoming ball distribution using the ball-racket contact model. Any sampling based approach (e.g. rejection sampling) may be used to simulate then the outgoing ball trajectory and approximate the resulting landing distribution. 


\section{ALGORITHM}\label{alg}

\section{EXPERIMENTS}\label{results}

% % % CHANGE THE WRITING HERE !!! OTHERWISE ITS THE SAME AS PREVIOUS ARTICLE

% % % % Table Tennis Setup % % % %
For the robotic table tennis task we are using a seven degree of freedom (DoF) torque-controlled custom made Barrett WAM arm capable of high speeds and accelerations. A standard size racket (16 cm diameter) is mounted on the end-effector of the arm as can be seen in Figure~\ref{robot}. A vision system consisting of four cameras hanging from the ceiling around each corner of the table is used for tracking the ball \cite{Lampert12}. The orange ball is tracked visually with a sampling rate of 60 Hz and filtered with an EKF that accounts for some of the bouncing behavior of the ball and air drag effects. The table and the tennis balls are in accordance with the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) rules.
%
A ball launcher (see Figure~\ref{robot}) is available to throw balls accurately to a fixed position in Cartesian space to the forehand of the robot. The incoming ball arrives with low-variability in desired positions and higher-variability in ball velocities. The whole area to be covered amounts to about 1 m$^2$ circular region surrounding the initial forehand posture of the robot. This allows us to avoid the singularities of the robot. Any ball that appears outside of this circular \emph{feasible} region will not be hit.
%
After the visual system predicts a ball trajectory that coincides with the feasible region in Cartesian space, the motion planning system has to come up with a trajectory that specifies how, where and when to intercept the incoming ball. 
%Desired Cartesian position, velocity and orientations of the racket translate in joint space to a specification of 14 parameters: 7 joint angles and 7 joint velocities of the robot arm. Along with the desired hitting time (or the time until impact), these 15 parameters are used to train 7 joint space trajectories that correspond to the desired reference trajectory in Cartesian space.
%
In runtime, in order to generate feasible reference trajectories that account for the variations in incoming ball position and velocities, we run the robust trajectory generation framework $\alg$. We start these joint reference trajectories from the initial posture of the robot provided by the sensors.
% From Katharina's paper:
%the position, velocity and orientation of the racket can be computed analytically based on the state of the system and the target on the opponents court.
%These task space parameters can also be converted into joint space parameters using inverse kinematics

Due to the limitations of our setup, our robot is fixed to the ceiling. Hence we expect that the balls that hit the frontal areas of the robots table will not be hit. The table can be brought closer to the robot to overcome this limitation: however then the trajectory generation problem will be subsequently harder, and the hard constraint of hitting the table becomes more problematic to avoid.

\section{CONCLUSION}\label{end}

% stochastic optimal control
We see the probabilistic extensions of Pontryagin's minimum principle as a very fruitful direction for robotics in general in the upcoming years, as robots start taking decisions in complex, demanding tasks. The robot trajectories to be generated can also taken to be probabilistic, leading to an optimization framework that considers the interaction between two probability distributions. We consider the probabilistic movement primitives~\cite{Paraschos13} to be a step in the right direction.

% reinforcement learning to modify trajectories

The cost functional to be minimized considers the accelerations as the quantity to be minimized. It assumes that the feedback linearization of the robot is perfect, that is the inverse dynamics model for the robot is exact. Whenever the cancellation is imperfect due to inaccurate robot control, execution error will prevent the robot from achieving the desired trajectories. Execution errors are not taken into consideration within this framework. 

A natural reward signal to use for reinforcement learning is to look at the set-distance of the landing point from the opponents court. This reward can be used to modify the generated trajectories and learn to compensate for the execution errors. Another promising approach is Iterative Learning Control (ILC), see for example \cite{Bristow06}, \cite{Longman2000}, \cite{Koc15}. ILC is a more efficient learning approach that generally makes more assumptions. Generalizing ILC to different trajectories generated by $\alg$, we hope to increase the performance of our robot further.
